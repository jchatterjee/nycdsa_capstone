# How Fast Can You CitiBike?
 CitiBike Machine Learning Project (Capstone)
 
The purpose of this study was to derive a machine learning model to predict ride durations for various riders of NYC CitiBike based on numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The full conclusions can be found written here:

https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/how-fast-can-you-citibike/

The following Jupyter notebooks have been used in this order to visualize the data:

DA_Q1_Rider_Behavior.ipynb for overall city-wide rider behavior

DA_Q1_Rider_Behavior-eBike.ipynb for city-wide rider behavior with respect to eBikes (see link to companion project below)

The following Jupyter notebooks have been used in this order to build the machine learning model:

ML_Q4_Data_Cleaning.ipynb for eliminating outliers skewing the data

ML_Q4_Durations.ipynb for testing machine learning algorithms to arrive at the most successful model

However, the following Jupyter notebooks were developed here to power the companion project in the link below due to the cleanliness of the data that had already been established in this repository:

CB_Econ_Data_Analysis.ipynb for visualizing the full consumer behaviors and financial health of the Lyft CitiBike business

CB_Mode_Optimization.ipynb for studying the optimal distances for CitiBike usage at various tiers of membership with respect to both time and money
